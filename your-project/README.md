## Project Description
Ruba Mazzetto ("Steal my Stash" or "Snap" in English) is a relatively simple card game played by adults to teach children how to make addition. It is played with 40 cards by 2 to 4 players.

## Rules
The goal of Ruba Mazzetto is to get as many cards as possible. Each card = 1 point. After shuffling the deck, the dealer deals 3 cards to each player and lays 4 cards face up on the table. The remaining cards are stacked into a draw pile. The first player take the turn: each turn a single card is played to "capture" one or more cards that matches the value of the card played. If no cards matches, the card is put on the table face up. When the cards a re captured, they are piled face up in each player's pile. A player may steal the other player's statch by matching the value of the cards. When players run out of cards, three more cards are dealt. At the end of the game, the player with more cards wins.

For the project to start, I aim at a simplified version of the game:
2 players
1 card dealt each round (no choice)
4 cards on the table
